Introduction to the MHC-PMS
===========================

A regional health authority wishes to procure an patient management system
(PMS) to manage the care of patients suffering from mental health problems. 
The overall goals of the system are:

1. To provide medical staff with timely information to facilitate the 
   treatment of patients.
2. To generate management information that allows health service managers
   to assess performance against local and government targets.

Most mental health patients do not require dedicated hospital treatment but
need to attend specialist clinics regularly where they can meet a doctor who
has detailed knowledge of their problems. The health authority has a number of
clinics that patients may attend. To make it easier for patients to attend,
these clinics are not just run in hospitals. They may also be held in local
medical practices or community centres. Patients need not always attend the
same clinic and some clinics may support ‘drop in’ as well as pre-arranged
appointments.

The nature of mental health problems is such that patients are often
disorganised so may miss appointments, deliberately or accidentally lose
prescriptions and medication, forget instructions and make unreasonable
demands on medical staff. In a minority of cases, they may be a danger to
themselves or to other people. They may regularly change address and may be 
omeless on a long-term or short-term basis. Where patients are dangerous,
they may need to be ‘sectioned’ – confined to a secure hospital for treatment
and observation.

Users of the system include clinical staff (doctors, nurses, health visitors),
receptionists who make appointments and medical records staff. Reports are
generated for hospital management by medical records staff. Management have
no direct access to the system.

The system is affected by two pieces of legislation

1. Data Protection Act that governs the confidentiality of personal information
2. Mental Health Act that governs the compulsory detention of patients deemed
   to be a danger to themselves or others.

The system is NOT a complete medical records system where all information about
a patients’ medical treatment is maintained. It is solely intended to support
mental health care so if a patient is suffering from some other unrelated
condition (such as high blood pressure) this would not be formally recorded
in the system.

Imagine you are working for MICT Inc., the company who won the contract for
implementing the MHC-PMS.

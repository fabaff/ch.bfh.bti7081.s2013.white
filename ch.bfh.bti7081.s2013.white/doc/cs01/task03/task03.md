(see also the file "questions.md")

### 1. Scoping (Defining the problem) 
(presentation: Fabian)

- Developing a patient management system of patients suffering from mental health problems. 
- The target users are psychotherapists (doctors and psychologists) in clinics (mental health hospials and local medical practices).
- The application can be used on tablets and notebooks (a smartphones-app is not convenient for psychotherapists needs).
- Focus on treatment related functionality and not general medical administration.
- Short time horizon: Constrain the feature scope of the application to a few key features.
- The success can be measured by a closely interaction with the target users (demo and validation for each functionality of the software).

### 2. Research 
(presentation: Patrick)

- Interview with a doctor (inner medicine) from the "Inselspital".
- Short demo of the "Krankenhausinformationssystem" (CGM Phoenix) from the "Inselspital".


### 3. Synthesize

Task 03

(see also the file "questions.md")

### 1. Scoping (Defining the problem) 
(presentation: Fabian)

- Developing a patient management system of patients suffering from mental health problems. 
- The target users are psychotherapists (doctors and psychologists) in clinics (mental health hospials and local medical practices).
- The application can be used on tablets and notebooks (a smartphones-app is not convenient for psychotherapists needs).
- Focus on treatment related functionality and not general medical administration.
- Short time horizon: Constrain the feature scope of the application to a few key features.
- The success can be measured by a closely interaction with the target users (demo and validation for each functionality of the software).

### 2. Research 
(presentation: Patrick)

- Interview with a doctor (inner medicine) from the "Inselspital".
- Short demo of the "Krankenhausinformationssystem" (CGM Phoenix) from the "Inselspital".

Some discussed questions:
- What is the most important information about a patient from the doctors perspective?
-- personal data (name, age, gender, ...)


- How are the appointments of a doctor fixed?

- Communication between doctors and nurses?

Specific questions to psychiatry:
- Differentiation of psychiatrist and psychologist?
both are psychotherapists

- How are consultations in the psychiatry organized?


### 3. Synthesize 
(presentation: Arthur)

- The application shows only the relevant patients from a specific doctor
- User requirements

### 4. Design 
(presentation: Marc)

User requirements:
- Show personal data of each patient
- Diagnosis of a patient: show, add, update, delete
- Drug management (point in time, frequency, dose): show, add, update, delete
- Orders to other clinical staff: show, add, update, delete
- Process and event handling of a patient: show, add, update, delete

- Central data management

#Task 05 - Requirements Review

- Based on the review categories given in script 03.07 on slide 2, conduct a
requirements review of the requirements document from Task 4:
 - Team White reviews the document from Team Red

- Document your results in a short review report table, including recommendations 
how the requirements document could be improved.

##Requirements checking:
• **Comprehensibility**: Is the requirement properly understood?
• **Validity**: Will the system provide the functions which best support the
customer’s needs?
• **Consistency**: Are there any requirement conflicts?
• **Completeness**: Are all functions required by the customer included?
• **Realism**: Can the requirements be implemented given available budget and
technology
• **Verifiability**: Can the requirements be checked?
• **Traceability**: Is the origin of the requirement clearly stated?
• **Adaptability**: Can the requirement be changed without a large impact on
other requirements?

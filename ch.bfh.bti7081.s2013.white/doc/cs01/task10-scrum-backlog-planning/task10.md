#Task 10 - Scrum Backlog Planning

From now on, your team will work in Scrum mode. Roles are
- developers = you
- Scrum master = one of you (best with development or even Scrum experience)
- product owner = me

Based on your CS1 project results so far, conduct a

- product planning meeting, resulting in a product backlog that reflects
  - user requirements and scenarios
  - priorities defined by product owner

- sprint planning meeting, resulting in a first overall sprint backlog
  - translate product backlog items into low-level implementation tasks
- for both, use the template from the course web site
